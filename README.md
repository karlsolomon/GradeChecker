# GradeChecker
Automatically checks the UT Grade Report page for updates to your grade

This tool will automatically check you UT Grade Report periodically to see if any of your grades have changed.
If a change is observed you will receive an email.

How to use/limitations due to program infancy:

0. Download and run the GradeChecker.jar file 

1. Gmail compatible only.

2. Enumerate all Courses and Unique IDs that you want feedback for. (there's a GUI for this)

3. To change the frequency of the check or which classes you want to check: close the running program and restart it.

4. leave the little countdown/timer window open if you want this to continue running. Closing this will terminate the program. 


Please feel free to give me feedback on ways that I can improve/fix or any features that you'd like to see added.
Please also feel free to make revisions to this if you'd like to contribute as well.
